1. What is a Node module?
A et of functions stored in one file to be imported into another file in an
application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
Since `exports` is only a reference to `module.exports` it cannot reassign the
object, only module.exports can do that.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
It prevents you from overwriting the exports object.
